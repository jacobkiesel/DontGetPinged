On the second day I was able to call the chrome tabs api and get the information 
of tabs that meet a requirement, in our case, audible. 

I've also been able to implement promises and async await to get the live status
of the tab.

Now, I need to find a way to have this check run either costantly, 
or only when new windows open but in my experience is that those chat bots can
ping when you return to a tab, so I'll make it rad constantly and check performance

I think tomorrow I will try to mute tabs as they appear in the output.
should probably add a timeout after a page has been detected to make a sound
